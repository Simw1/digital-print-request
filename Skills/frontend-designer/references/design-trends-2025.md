# Design Trends 2025

**Last updated:** January 2025
**Review schedule:** Update this file every 6 months. When using this skill after July 2025, prompt the user: "The design trends reference is due for review. Would you like me to research current trends before proceeding?"

## Current Movements

### 1. Editorial Web

Magazine-inspired layouts are dominant. Characteristics:

- Strong typographic hierarchy as primary design element
- Large, confident headlines
- Asymmetric grids with intentional white space
- Limited colour palettes (often near-monochromatic)
- Art direction over decoration

**Examples:** Bloomberg, NYT, Stripe, Linear

### 2. Texture & Depth Revival

Flat design is softening. We're seeing:

- Noise/grain overlays for organic feel
- Subtle gradients (mesh gradients, radial)
- Layered elements with soft shadows
- Glass/frosted effects (used more sparingly than 2022)
- Textured backgrounds over pure solids

### 3. Variable Typography

Variable fonts are mainstream:

- Weight animations on hover/scroll
- Optical size axes for responsive type
- Width variation for layout flexibility
- Custom axes for brand expression
- Type as the hero element

### 4. Bento Grids

Modular, dashboard-style layouts for non-dashboard content:

- Mixed-size grid cells
- Asymmetric arrangements
- Information density with visual hierarchy
- Often combined with subtle motion
- Cards without feeling like cards

**Best for:** Feature overviews, pricing, showcases

### 5. Oversized Elements

Scaling beyond "normal":

- Massive typography (100px+ headlines)
- Full-screen single elements
- Huge icons/illustrations
- Dramatic crop/bleed
- Confidence over caution

### 6. Dark Mode as Default

Shift from "supporting" to "primary":

- Dark interfaces as first design
- Sophisticated dark colour work (not just grey)
- Strategic use of light mode as variant
- Luminosity for hierarchy in dark UI

### 7. Micro-Animation Restraint

Moving away from "animate everything":

- Fewer, more meaningful animations
- Single orchestrated moment (page load) over scattered micro-interactions
- Interaction feedback: purposeful, quick
- Scroll-triggered reserved for key moments
- Performance consciousness

### 8. Photography Integration

Moving beyond generic stock:

- Editorial photography over illustration
- Custom art direction
- Duotone/colour overlay treatments
- Full-bleed imagery with type overlay
- Mixed media (photo + graphic)

### 9. Anti-Minimalism (Selective)

Some contexts embracing density:

- Information-rich dashboards
- Data-heavy interfaces
- Maximalist but structured
- Purposeful complexity
- Not "more for more's sake" but "appropriate density"

### 10. AI Aesthetic Backlash

Explicit rejection of generated-feeling design:

- Handmade/craft aesthetics
- Imperfection as character
- Distinctive over "optimised"
- Human fingerprint visible
- Anti-polished polish

## Emerging (Watch List)

### Spatial Design Language

Preparing for spatial computing:

- Z-axis awareness
- Depth hierarchy
- Layered interfaces
- 3D UI elements (subtle)

### Generative Patterns

AI-assisted but intentional:

- Custom pattern generation
- Procedural backgrounds
- Data-driven visuals
- Unique per-render elements

### Brutalist Refinement

Raw aesthetic maturing:

- Structured brutalism
- Intentional "ugly"
- Technical aesthetics
- Terminal/code visuals

## Fading Trends

### Declining Use

- Blob shapes as decoration
- Glassmorphism everywhere
- Neumorphism (mostly dead)
- Excessive gradients on everything
- Generic 3D illustrations
- Soft, rounded everything
- Millennial pink

### Context-Dependent

Some trends still valid in specific contexts:

- Illustration-heavy (works for some brands)
- Ultra-minimal (works for luxury)
- Bright colours (works for consumer/playful)

Don't dismiss categorically—evaluate for context fit.

## Application Guidelines

### For Critique

When flagging dated elements, reference specific trends:

- "This gradient style peaked 2020–2021"
- "Card grid layout reads as 2019 SaaS"
- "Consider editorial approach—current expectation for this sector"

### For Recommendations

Match trend to context:

- Corporate: Editorial, texture, restrained motion
- Consumer: Bolder colour, oversized elements, personality
- Tech/SaaS: Dark mode, bento, information density
- Creative: Anti-convention, texture, art direction

### Avoid Trend-Chasing

Trends inform, they don't dictate:

- Classic approaches remain valid if well-executed
- Trend-appropriate ≠ good design
- Timeless > trendy if forced to choose
- Context-appropriate > currently-popular
