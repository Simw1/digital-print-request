# Personality Framework

Define brand personality through positioning on meaningful spectrums and translating those positions into tangible expressions.

## Core Spectrums

Position the brand on each spectrum with a specific point (not "in the middle"):

### Voice Spectrums

**Formal ↔ Casual**
- Formal: Third person, complete sentences, no contractions, measured pace
- Casual: First/second person, fragments OK, contractions, conversational
- Example: "We have received your request" vs "Got it!"

**Technical ↔ Accessible**
- Technical: Precise terminology, assumes knowledge, efficient
- Accessible: Plain language, explanations, patient
- Example: "Configure your API endpoints" vs "Set up how your app talks to us"

**Authoritative ↔ Collaborative**
- Authoritative: Declarative statements, expert position, guides
- Collaborative: Questions, partnership language, explores together
- Example: "Do this" vs "Let's figure this out"

### Emotional Spectrums

**Serious ↔ Playful**
- Serious: Weight to words, measured, considered
- Playful: Light touch, wit permitted, doesn't take itself too seriously
- Example: "Error occurred" vs "Oops, something went sideways"

**Reserved ↔ Expressive**
- Reserved: Understated, lets work speak, subtle
- Expressive: Enthusiastic, celebrates, emotional
- Example: "Task complete" vs "You did it! 🎉"

**Warm ↔ Cool**
- Warm: Personal, empathetic, human
- Cool: Professional, efficient, business-like
- Example: "We understand this is frustrating" vs "Issue acknowledged"

### Visual Spectrums

**Traditional ↔ Progressive**
- Traditional: Established conventions, familiar patterns, proven approaches
- Progressive: Breaks rules, unexpected, experimental
- Example: Centered layouts with serifs vs asymmetric layouts with variable fonts

**Refined ↔ Raw**
- Refined: Polished, precise, controlled
- Raw: Textured, imperfect, energetic
- Example: Clean vectors vs hand-drawn elements

**Minimal ↔ Maximal**
- Minimal: Reduction, white space, essentialism
- Maximal: Abundance, density, richness
- Example: Single accent colour vs full palette expression

**Geometric ↔ Organic**
- Geometric: Sharp angles, mathematical relationships, structured
- Organic: Curves, natural forms, flowing
- Example: Grid-locked layouts vs fluid, responsive compositions

## Personality Translation

Once spectrum positions are established, translate to concrete expressions:

### Voice Translation

| Spectrum Position | Implications |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Casual + Playful | Contractions, exclamations, emoji OK, humor welcome |
| Formal + Warm | Complete sentences, but personal pronouns, empathy expressed professionally |
| Technical + Collaborative | Precise terms, but "we" language, explains while doing |

### Visual Translation

| Spectrum Position | Implications |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Progressive + Refined | Unexpected but polished, breaks rules precisely |
| Traditional + Raw | Familiar structures with texture and imperfection |
| Minimal + Warm | Clean but not cold, white space feels inviting not sterile |

### Motion Translation

| Spectrum Position | Implications |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Playful + Expressive | Bouncy easing, overshoot, longer durations, surprise moments |
| Serious + Refined | Precise easing, exact timing, purposeful and efficient |
| Warm + Reserved | Gentle easing, subtle motion, never jarring |

## Archetype Reference

Archetypes can anchor personality but shouldn't constrain it. Use as starting points:

**The Expert**: Authoritative, technical, serious, refined
**The Guide**: Warm, collaborative, accessible, patient  
**The Innovator**: Progressive, expressive, playful, experimental
**The Craftsperson**: Reserved, refined, traditional, precise
**The Friend**: Casual, warm, playful, accessible
**The Rebel**: Raw, progressive, expressive, breaks rules

Mix and modify. "Expert with warmth" or "Innovator with precision" creates more interesting positions than pure archetypes.

## Anti-Patterns

**Personality Without Teeth**
- "We're friendly and professional" (says nothing)
- "We balance innovation with reliability" (fence-sitting)
- Fix: Commit to specific positions, accept tradeoffs

**Inconsistent Application**
- Playful voice but sterile visuals
- Progressive design but formal copy
- Fix: Translate personality consistently across all touchpoints

**Aspirational vs Actual**
- Claims to be warm but error messages are cold
- Says playful but never takes a risk
- Fix: Personality must be expressed, not just stated
