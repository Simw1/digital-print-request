# Visual Principles

Enduring design principles that transcend trends. Apply regardless of aesthetic direction.

## Hierarchy

Every composition needs clear visual priority. The eye should know where to go first, second, third.

### Establishing Hierarchy

**Size**: Largest element reads first. Use deliberately.

**Contrast**: High contrast attracts before low contrast. A dark element on light background dominates.

**Position**: Top-left (in LTR languages) and centre draw attention. Strategic placement guides flow.

**Density**: Areas of detail attract attention against areas of simplicity.

**Colour**: Saturated and warm colours advance; desaturated and cool recede.

**Motion**: Movement attracts before stillness (use responsibly).

### Common Hierarchy Failures

- **Everything loud**: If everything is emphasised, nothing is
- **Hidden primary action**: CTA buried among visual noise
- **Competing focal points**: Multiple elements fighting for attention
- **Flat hierarchy**: All elements treated equally, user has no entry point

## Contrast

Visual interest and readability depend on contrast. Design dies in the middle ground.

### Types of Contrast

**Value contrast**: Light vs dark. Most important for readability.

**Scale contrast**: Large vs small. Creates drama and hierarchy.

**Weight contrast**: Bold vs light. Typographic emphasis.

**Texture contrast**: Smooth vs rough. Surface interest.

**Temperature contrast**: Warm vs cool. Colour tension.

**Density contrast**: Busy vs sparse. Visual rhythm.

### Using Contrast

- Lead with one primary contrast (usually value or scale)
- Support with secondary contrast (temperature, weight)
- Avoid competing contrasts that cancel each other
- High contrast for key elements; low contrast for supporting elements

### Contrast and Accessibility

Minimum value contrast requirements exist for function, not just aesthetics:
- Text: 4.5:1 (normal), 3:1 (large)
- UI components: 3:1 against adjacent colours

## Balance

Visual equilibrium. Not symmetry (necessarily) but weight distribution that feels resolved.

### Symmetrical Balance

- Formal, stable, traditional
- Equal weight on both sides of centre
- Creates calm, ordered feeling
- Risk: Static, predictable

### Asymmetrical Balance

- Dynamic, modern, energetic
- Unequal elements that balance through weight
- Large light element vs small dark element
- More interesting, requires skill

### Radial Balance

- Elements arranged around centre point
- Draws eye to centre
- Useful for focus moments
- Risk: Can feel dated if not executed well

### Balance Principles

- Visual weight increases with: size, darkness, saturation, density, isolation
- Counterbalance heavy elements with lighter elements at greater distance
- White space has weight (negative space balances positive)

## Rhythm and Repetition

Consistency creates cohesion. Variation creates interest. The interplay is rhythm.

### Establishing Rhythm

**Spatial rhythm**: Consistent spacing creates predictable pattern. Use a scale.

**Visual rhythm**: Repeated elements (shapes, colours, type styles) create continuity.

**Structural rhythm**: Grid establishes underlying beat.

### Breaking Rhythm

Intentional breaks create emphasis:
- Larger gap signals section change
- Different element signals importance
- Unexpected item draws attention

Break rhythm rarely and purposefully. Too many breaks = no rhythm.

### Spacing Systems

Base unit creates mathematical relationships:
- 4px base: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64...
- 8px base: 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96...

Everything aligns to the base unit. Creates invisible coherence.

## Proportion

Relationships between elements. Good proportion feels "right" without being obvious.

### Classical Proportions

**Golden ratio (1:1.618)**: Found in nature, pleasing to eye. Use for rectangles, spacing relationships.

**Rule of thirds**: Divide into 9 parts, place key elements at intersections.

**Square root proportions**: √2 (1:1.414), √3 (1:1.732). Paper sizes use √2.

### Modern Proportion Systems

**Modular scale**: Related sizes derived from ratio (see Typography Systems).

**Grid proportions**: Column relationships (4/12, 8/12, etc.).

**Container proportions**: Common aspect ratios (16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 9:16).

### Proportion Principles

- Avoid arbitrary sizes; derive from relationships
- Similar proportions create harmony; contrasting proportions create tension
- Small proportional differences look like mistakes; go similar or clearly different

## Unity and Variety

Cohesion vs interest. Too much unity = boring. Too much variety = chaos.

### Creating Unity

- Shared colour palette
- Consistent typography
- Repeated shapes or motifs
- Aligned spacing system
- Common visual language

### Creating Variety

- Scale variation within consistent elements
- Colour accent against neutral base
- Typographic emphasis within hierarchy
- Unexpected element as focal point
- Texture or pattern variation

### The Balance

Strong unity foundation, selective variety for interest:
- 80% consistent elements, 20% variety
- Unity in system, variety in application
- Base rules, occasional rule-breaking

## White Space

Empty space is design element, not leftover.

### Functions of White Space

**Breathing room**: Prevents overwhelm, aids comprehension.

**Grouping**: Related items close; unrelated items far.

**Emphasis**: Isolation draws attention.

**Sophistication**: Generous space signals confidence, quality.

### Using White Space

- **Macro white space**: Margins, gutters, section breaks. Defines overall openness.
- **Micro white space**: Padding, line-height, letter-spacing. Affects readability.

### White Space Failures

- **Cluttered**: No room to breathe, everything competes
- **Cramped**: Trying to fit too much in space available
- **Wasted**: Empty space without purpose (different from intentional space)
- **Inconsistent**: Varying space without logic

## Grid Systems

Invisible structure that creates visible order.

### Grid Types

**Column grid**: Vertical divisions. Standard for web layout.

**Modular grid**: Columns + rows. More control, more complex.

**Hierarchical grid**: Custom divisions based on content. Flexible, requires skill.

**Baseline grid**: Horizontal lines for type alignment. Precision typography.

### Grid Principles

- Grid is tool, not prison. Breaking grid deliberately creates emphasis.
- Establish grid early, apply consistently
- Fewer columns = simpler; more columns = flexibility
- Grid should serve content, not constrain it

### Responsive Grids

- Mobile: Often single column or simple 2-up
- Tablet: Adapt columns, not just scale
- Desktop: Full grid expression
- Large screens: Constrain max-width or expand gutters

## Visual Tension

Interest comes from managed tension. Too little = boring. Too much = uncomfortable.

### Creating Tension

- **Proximity tension**: Elements almost touching
- **Edge tension**: Elements near but not at edges
- **Scale tension**: Extreme size difference
- **Alignment tension**: Slight misalignment (use carefully)
- **Expectation tension**: Breaking established pattern

### Resolving Tension

Some tension should be resolved (creates satisfaction):
- Alignment completed
- Pattern continues
- Balance achieved

Some tension maintained (creates energy):
- Dynamic composition
- Sense of movement
- Active not static

### Dangerous Tension

Avoid tension that looks like error:
- Elements almost but not quite aligned
- Spacing almost but not quite consistent
- Colours almost but not quite matching

Either align fully or misalign deliberately.
